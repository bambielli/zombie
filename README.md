The age old question "Does Floyds have Zombie Dust" will be finally answered!

Manifesto:

Zombie dust is the nectar of the gods...the stuff of legends...delicious hop-ey goodness that is, as of late, in short supply and high demand.

Three floyds used to be vocal about when zombie was available for pickup at the brewpub. Alas, they are vocal No more...With seemingly arbitrary releases of ZD that receive no form of notification for the masses other than a silent update to the "beers to go" page on their website.

The mission of this site is to give a voice back to Zombie Dust searchers across the Chicagoland area: To inform the masses when Zombie goes back on sale at the brewpub, so loyal supporters can make the pilgrimmage back to floyds to refuel and restock.

Stay Zombie my friends.
